# Wormhole Lending Examples

example-1 is a basic lending skeleton that sketches out lending and borrowing between two chains using Wormhole

example-2 is a more fully fledged cross-chain example using a Hub and Spoke model, allowing lending and borrowing on an arbitrary number of chains using Wormhole. 

Both of these examples have specific READMEs in their respective folders. 

**WARNING**: This repository has not been audited, so it may contain bugs and should be used for example purposes only. If you intend to use or build on either of these examples to perform actual lending, it's highly recommended that you have the final code commit audited by a smart contract auditing firm.
